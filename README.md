Abstract: Helicobacter pylori urease (HpU) plays a central role in bacterial survival and virulence by hydro-lyzing urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, neutralizing gastric acidity, and facilitating host colonization. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance underscores the need for alternative strategies targeting essential bacterial enzymes such as urease. In this study, a multistage compu-tational pipeline integrating pharmacophore modeling, machine learning (ML), ensemble docking, and enhanced molecular dynamics simulations were applied to identify novel triazole-based HpU inhibitors. Starting from over seven million compounds in the ZINC15 database, pharmacophore- and ML-based filters progressively reduced the chemical space to 7,062 candidates. Ensemble docking across 25 conformational frames of HpU, followed by quantum-polarized ligand docking (QPLD), identified seven promising ligands exhibiting strong geometric mean binding energies and stable metal coordination. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations under progressively relaxed re-straints revealed three highly stable complexes (CA1, CA3, and CA6). Subsequent well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD) simulations reconstructed free-energy landscapes showing deep, lo-calized basins for CA3 and CA6, comparable to the potent reference inhibitor DJ, supporting their potential as strong urease binders. Finally, unsupervised chemical space mapping using the UMAP algorithm positioned these candidates within molecular regions associated with potent urease in-hibitors, further validating their structural coherence and pharmacophoric relevance. This multi-level screening strategy demonstrates the power of combining AI-driven classification, ensemble docking, and enhanced sampling simulations to discover non-hydroxamic urease inhibitors. Alt-hough the current findings are computational, they provide a rational foundation for future in vitro validation and for expanding the discovery of triazole-based scaffolds targeting ureolytic enzymes.
